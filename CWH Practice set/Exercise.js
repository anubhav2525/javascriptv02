// Write a JavaScript program to generate a random number and store it in a variable. The program then takes an input from the user to tell them whether the guess was correct, greater or lesser than the original number.

// 100 – (no of guesses) is the score of the user. The program is expected to terminate once the number is guesses. Number should be between 1 – 100.
